# 9292Hoi - A Gamified Voice-based Travel Companion

## Introduction
This is a project design for the 9292 AI Challenge. The idea of this project is to bring a new feature to the 9292 app, which is a voice-based travel companion. The user can ask the voice assistant about the public transport in the Netherlands, about the travel information during their trips and the assistant will provide you with details information. The app can also give the user advice about the best route to take to get to a certain destination, some updates about delay or stops and some recommendations for local places. The app is also gamified, which means that the user can earn coins through their travel, which can help user engaging in their travel experience. The user can also use the coins to buy the customizations for their travel companion (the voice).
